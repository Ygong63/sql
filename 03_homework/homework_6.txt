Ethics and Equity Adjustments:

Data Minimization:
Only collect and store data that is absolutely necessary for the purposes of the application. 
Avoid collecting excessive personal information.

Security and Access to Data:
Implement role-based access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive data.
    CREATE ROLE data_entry;
    CREATE ROLE data_analyst;
    GRANT SELECT ON customer TO data_analyst;
    GRANT INSERT, UPDATE ON customer TO data_entry;
Ensure database backups are also encrypted and stored securely.
Maintain an audit trail of who accessed or modified data and when. 

Bias Mitigation:
Regularly review and analyze data for biases that could influence outcomes or analyses. 
Ensure that database schemas can handle diverse data types and categories to represent different groups.
